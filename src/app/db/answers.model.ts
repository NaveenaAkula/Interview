I don’t see the conflict in a negative way because it gives you the chance of improving yourself one way or the other. I can give you an example, in my last job we were rewriting the application we have design review meeting and me and my coworker have the proof of concepts. We have solutions with different perspectives.  At that time, I went by considering the fact checks like which one will be the performant and maintainable code. We resolved the conflict by communication. keeping our perspectivse infront. At the end, I feel that If my coworker solutions are the best I will learn from that and reiterate through what I have missed. The other positive thing is we can solve the issue by communicating to the coworker about the issue. So that we can give the best output as a team..`

Mainly my team is more focused on backend work related to API’s. Recently, due to architectural changes our team got assigned to rewrite an application and the tech stack for that is the client-side angular front-end framework and backend spring boot. At that point, everyone is on the same boat. But I do have an experience working with angular. I have built multiple applications. So, I took this opportunity to showcase my skills. I took the initiative and worked on the majority part of the angular application. At the end, the output was awesome and my team members, business people gave me the appreciation for the work I did. So, I feel that was the greatest achievement.`

Alternatively, if there is no other option than to rework the project (which may impact on meeting the deadline), the first thing that I do is to notify my seniors/ Tech lead. So they will be helping to decide whether  to reschedule my  day or work longer to finish the project and meet the deadline or move the story to next iteration. I can give you an example that I faced in the physicians mutual. In our team we juggle between multiple projects with different tech stack like angular, java development for APIs and we do use salesforce too. I was pretty new to salesforce. To gain knowledge in salesforce I used to do multiple trail heads. In my starting days, I got assigned to a salesforce story, i don’t say it is a failure I was trying to do trail heads and do the story but I couldn’t. So, I went to my senior and asked how to do that. He gave a link to documentation which points to that specific change. So I  did learn a lot while making the mistakes.`

Unfortunately, one day my senior need to leave the company. But we have angular tasks left. So, My manager asked me that whether will I be able to handle the tasks without my senior. I have told my manager that I can handle them on my own. My manager believed me and handled the all the angular tasks that left over. So, I had taken up the tasks and completed the tasks on time and gave them to testers to test.

                So I have decided that I am going to assign few tasks and build up small  projects. So,  I started spending 
                some of my spare time learning about full-stack development practices, and invested heavily in building a few 
                side projects to improve  my skills.  I had never missed a chance to grab the opportunity to learn things. 
                Once my professor asked us to build an application as part of my course work. I went to professor and I have 
                asked that I would like to build the application using Angular and backend Java. But he agreed to build an 
                application with Angular and Django python framework. I did  built the project and the outcome was awesome

                 Then I haver started working on easier story because when I complete one story, I can move that to 
                 testing so no one will have dependency on e they can start work especially testers. Then I will start

                            Still If I don’t get a good grip on it, I will start reading articles, nowadays many people are writing 
                            articles which helps us to understand the concepts easily by comparing the concept with real life

                    Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies
                    Dependency Injection Classes often require references to other classes. For example, a Train class might need a reference to an Engine class. These required classes are called dependencies, and in this example, the Train class is dependent on having an instance of the Engine class to run.

                @controller  - Controller is a common annotation that is used to mark a class as a spring MVC controller.
                @RestController - Rest controller is a Springspecial controller used in Restful web services and the wrapped within the @controller and @Responsebody

                @Configuration - used to mark a class as a source of the bean definitions. Beans are the components 
                of the system that you want to wire together. A method marked with the @Bean annotation is a bean 
                producer. Spring will handle the life cycle of the beans for you,and it will use these methods to 
                create the beans.
                
                @ComponentScan -use to make sure that Spring knows about your configuration classes and can 
                initialize the beans correctly.It makes Spring scan the packages configured with it for the
                @Configuration classes.
                
                @Import -  If you need even more precise control of the configuration classes, you can 
                always use @import  to load additional configuration. This one works even when 
                you specify the beans in an XML file like it's 1999.
                
                @Component - Another way to declare a bean is to mark a class with a @Component annotation. 
                Doing this turns the class into a Spring bean at the auto-scan time.

                @Service - Mark a specialization of a @Component. It tells Spring that it's safe to 
                manage them with more freedom than regular components. Remember, services have no 
                encapsulated state.
              
                @Autowired - To wire the application parts together, use the @Autowired on the fields,
                constructors, or methods in a component.Spring's dependency injection mechanism wires 
                appropriate beans into the class members marked with @Autowired.
                
                @Bean - A method-level annotation to specify a returned bean to be managed by Spring context.
                The returned bean has the same name as the factory method.
                
                @Lookup - tells Spring to return an instance of the method's return type when we invoke it.
                
                @Primary - gives higher preference to a bean when there are multiple beans of the same type.
                
                @Required - shows that the setter method must be configured to be dependency-injected 
                with a value at configuration time.Use @Required on setter methods to mark dependencies
                populated through XML.Otherwise, a BeanInitializationException is thrown.
                
                @Value - used to assign values into fields in Spring-managed beans. It's compatible 
                with the constructor, setter, and field injection.
                
                @Lazy - makes beans to initialize lazily. @Lazy annotation may be used on any class 
                directly or indirectly annotated with @Component or on methods annotated with @Bean.
                
                @Scope - used to define the scope of a @Component class or a @Bean definition and can be either 
                singleton, prototype, request, session, globalSession, or custom scope.
                
                @Profile - adds beans to the application only when that profile is active.`

                Monolithic architectures are the simplest form of architecture as it is having only one application layer that 
                bundles together all the software components, and is hosted and delivered together. This type has been widely 
                used by many small and mid-sized companies. The main challenge in this system is during scaling up as we need to 
                duplicate the whole system including all the features of other machines which increases the cost. Also, the failure 
                of one feature will affect the whole system making it unreliable.

                Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) follows a coarse-grained structure where the features of an application are broken 
                down into smaller components as services comprised of some tasks. This type of architecture allowed us to horizontally 
                scale each service, and also more flexibility and performance at the cost of increasing the complexity of the architecture 
                compared to the monolithic. Each service can be written in different languages and the communication between them can be 
                done with the help of a middleware
               
                Microservices has technically evolved out of SOA where those features are further broken down into tasks level services
                 making it fine-grained architecture. While Service Oriented Architecture followed a centrally governed architecture 
                 where each component is controlled by a central middleware, in microservices it’s a decentralized governing system 
                 where components talk directly to each other and can be written in different programming languages and communicate 
                 without the help of any broker and are done with the help of REST API. `

                Advantages:

                        Minimal work team
                        Scalability
                        Modular functionality, independent modules.
                        Developer freedom to develop and deploy services independently
                        Use of containers, allowing for a quick deployment and development of the application
                Disadvantages

                    High memory use
                    Time required to fragment different microservices
                    Complexity of managing a large number of services
                    Developer need to solve problems such as network latency or load balancing
                    Complex testing over the distributed deployment `

                Advantages of Angular:

                It is very easy to develop applications in Angular.
                Angular can distribute a single block into multiple blocks. Hence, gives the developer the ease to act on the components individually.
                Angular enjoys large community support since it is the oldest framework available.
                Since it has a component-based structure, its components can be used again.
                The programming quality on Angular is very high, thus it gives good programming feel to the programmers.
                It consists of built-in functionalities.
                Disadvantages of Angular:
                
                It requires a lot of learning and study because of its complex syntax.
                Angular consists of a steep learning curve.
                
                
                Advantages of React:

                It has many tools that allow the developer to play with it and make changes.
                React enjoys good community support and developers and users keep contributing to it to maintain its relevance.
                React has an easy learning curve and it doesn’t require complex study for coding on it.
                It has high efficiency and flexibility. Due to this, its performance improves.
                Disadvantages of React:

                React doesn’t have an easy programming style so it is not understood by many.
                React uses JSX, instead of HTML.
                React focuses on creating UIs. Thus, you’ll need third-party libraries to make it.
                
                Advantages of Vue:

                Vue is the lightest framework at 20KB and simple to work.
                It integrates with other programming languages very easily.
                It is easier to work on Vue since it has an easy learning curve.
                Vue gives faster performance due to its small size.
                Users have started switching over to it over other options.
                It has good documentation.
                Disadvantages of Vue:

                It has a small community of users and developers in comparison to React and Angular.
                It is not very flexible when teaming up with large projects.
                Vue has very limited features.

                Closures provide a better, concise, creative, and expressive writing code for JavaScript developers and programmers. Technically speaking, closures are a combination of lexical environment and function.

                In other words, a closure is a locally declared variable that is related to a function and stays in the memory when the related function has returned. The closure contains all local variables that were in-scope at the time of the closure creation. `

                Interface:- An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behaviour that classes must implement.
               Abstraction:-
                the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.
                Eg:- man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know about how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car.
                
                Encapusaltion:- wrapping up of data and behaviour of an object under a single unit.The idea behind encapsulation is to 
                hide the implementation details from users. If a data member is private it means it can only be accessed 
                within the same class. No outside class can access private data member (variable) of other class.
               
                Inheritance:- Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class.
                
                Polymorphism: - Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
                eg:- A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations.
                Method Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.
